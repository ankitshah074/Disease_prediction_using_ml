(A WEB INERFACE FOR DISEASE PREDICTION SYSTEM)


# PROPOSED SYSTEM
Most of the chronic diseases are
predicted by our system. It accepts the
data as input to the machine learning
model. This system is used by end-users
i.e. patients/any user. In this system, the
user will enter all the symptoms from
which he or she is suffering. These
symptoms then will be analysed by our
machine learning model to predict the
disease. Then System will predict
whether they are affected by the disease
or not.

# CONCLUSION
The main aim of this disease prediction system is to predict the disease on
the basis of the symptoms.

This system takes the symptoms of the user from which he or she suffers
as input and generates final output as a prediction of disease.

Average prediction accuracy probability of 84% is obtained.

This system gives a user-friendly environment and easy to use.

As the system is based on the web application, the user can use this
system from anywhere and at any time.
